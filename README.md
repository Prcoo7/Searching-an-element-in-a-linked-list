code to search an element in a singly linked list

Linked List is a dynamic data structure to store homogeneous data in a sequential format. It stores the data along with the respective memory location for that data. So it consume a more memory but it is efficient than an Array in terms of various operations like insertion, deletion etc.

Searching an element in a linked list is little bit difficult than Array because we can search any element in array using its index but we need a hardcore coding to find the same thing in linked list. There are different codes for searching an element in linked list but the algorithm is common for all.
